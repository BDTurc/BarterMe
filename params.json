{"name":"BarterMe","tagline":"One Man's Trash is Another Man's Treasure.  BarterMe:  Making trading simple.  ","body":"### Welcome to BarterMe!\r\n\r\n## Who are We?\r\nBarterMe was created as a semester long project for Pito Salas' COSI166b course in Software Engineering at Brandeis University.  The team that created the project consisted of four members:  Shu Chen (shuchen@brandeis.edu), Phill Skokos(pskokos@brandeis.edu), Bryan Turcotte(bdturc@brandeis.edu), and Yahui Wang(wangyh@brandeis.edu).  Both Shu and Bryan are Masters Students in Computer Science, with Phill and Yahui graduating Seniors.\r\n\r\n## What is BarterMe?\r\n\r\nBarterMe is website built to facilitate the trading of goods between users.  It is similar to Craigslist, Ebay, etc., in the fact that it is something of an online flea-market, but differs in a number of ways.  \r\n1. BarterMe's goal is to facilitate trading of goods, not selling.  \r\n2. BarterMe attempts to _ease_ the complications of online trading.  One quick sign up and you will have tools\r\nlike the Barter Recommendation system and the \"Can I get it Score,\" in addition to other features designed to make finding the right trade easy for you.\r\n3. Simplicity.  BarterMe is designed to have little overhead, and should be easy to understand for any user.\r\n\r\n## Why use BarterMe?\r\n\r\nThat's the same as asking \"Why save my money?.\"  You may be able to sell that old camera on Ebay for $30 dollars so that you can afford to buy that $100 used textbook for next semester, but why go through the hassle of selling on Ebay, with the shipping, paypal, and costs of using the service, only to still have to spend 70 dollars out of your own pocket for a used book?  With BarterMe you could just as easily trade away your current semester's books with someone who has exactly what you need.  The payoff?  You get rid of your old books, get your new books for free, and it only took you **minutes** to do.  \r\nBut what if you're not a student?  Maybe you're an auto-parts dealer.  Now you can list all of your parts on BarterMe and get the parts you need by getting rid of the ones you don't want.  No cost whatsoever.  \r\nOr maybe you're a card collector, and you know you could sell two of your most valuable cards to the store to buy what you need.  But they're just taking your money!  With BarterMe, you could trade just one of those cards for what you want, simple as that.  \r\nBarterMe is for anyone who wants to save, and doesn't want the headache of sifting through a hundred Craigslist Postings, or the cost of using Ebay.  \r\n\r\n## Under the Hood\r\n\r\n### Our Database Schema\r\n\r\n### Supporting Tech\r\nBarterMe is made using Ruby On Rails, as well as various support gems and technologies.  \r\n* Languages:  In its entirety, BarterMe was constructed using Ruby 2.2.0, Rails 4.2.1, Javascript, CSS, and HTML.  \r\n* Support Gems:  We relied on several support libraries beyond those bundled with your normal rails project.  ElasticSearch and Searchkick for our on page searching, Kaminari for pagination, Bootstrap and its dependencies for much of the stylizing and layout, Bcrypt for authentication and sessions, CarrierWave and S3 for image loading and processing, and geocoder for our Location mapping.  \r\n* Supporting Technologies:  We used several testing kits, including:  CodeShip, CodeClimate, and loader.io during development, as well as GitHub for our code management.  Additionally, for the app itself, we rely on certain technologies for roles beyond those handled with internal gems.  These include:  \r\n1.  Pusher - Pusher handles real-time updating of information on BarterMe, and is used primarily for updating a user with notifications about the status of pending offers.  It does this through a \"Full Duplex Connection\" in which the browser and pusher establish a connection through a websocket (with the server providing the credentials).  But rather than close after the information is sent through, the connection remains live, allowing the browser to communicate with Pusher about updates as they occur.  \r\n2.  S3 - S3 is a cloud storage site run through Amazon.  By supplying credentials with use of the fog and figaro gems, S3 is able to communicate with the server and act as a private database.  This way, we can use S3's storage system for the large amount of image data, while keeping BarterMe lighter.  \r\n3.  Geocoder - Geocoder is a gem which communicates with mapping services like GoogleMaps in order to provide accurate location based information for us.  Without having to do any of the calculations in our own code, Geocoder can quickly give us distances between users that we can employ in our filters.  \r\n\r\n### Design and Engineering\r\nThe basic layout of BarterMe isn't all that complex.  At it's core it's just a trading site, where a user can list an item and another user can ask for it, the kind of site you would find in AWDR or Railstutorial for a new programmer to practice.  But once you get past the core, there's a bit more going on under the hood.  By keeping track of past actions (completed barters and ratings) and personal settings(distance to travel, categories looking for), we are able to generate recommendations that aren't just likely to be interesting to the user, but will also be easy to acquire.  But the neat thing is that we were able to do these recommendations, a predictor for your success in acquiring items, and a predictor for what item a user might want with just a handful of datapoints.  By determining in advance what sort of information we need to see each of those problems, we could keep our database from filling up with too much information, while still being able to provide accurate results without too much overhead.  The result is a fast load time, which is key for an e-commerce site, with useful information provided to the user on the top level, reducing the amount of time that a user will have to spend searching, and increasing the amount of time they will be actually performing trades on the site.  \r\n\r\n## Some Results\r\nWhile we have not used BarterMe significantly in the real world, we have demoed it several times among different audiences.  While at first it was obvious that we would need to do work on simplifying the layout, streamlining the User experience, and making features and presentation of information consistent, we were eventually able to receive positive feedback about these issues and the site as a whole.  While this is still a work in progress, the overall consensus is that features like the \"Can I get it Score\" and the simple \"This user may want...\" popover, make it a very appealing alternative to Craigslist, where you might have to mill through 30 postings of the same item to find a reasonable listing.  Additionally, by making the site uniform (all item displays are in the same format, language is consistent between pages, etc) and without a lot of different pages to see, it is simpler to navigate than its real-world counterparts.  \r\n\r\n### Some Screenshots\r\n\r\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cWssqN5RFMLTV_RYDRevw8rg-Ngs-IzW8Lfooukw5cEU07uoKO5MwpIUP3bFPPC6PwLCog=w1275-h521)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
